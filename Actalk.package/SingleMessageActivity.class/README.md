Class SingleAcceptActivity models activities for which we MAY assume that they are going to receive (and accept) only one single message.
This class creates a process body with only one single message acceptance. This avoids creating infinite processes which will create wasted resources and are difficult to recover.
Examples of uses are many classes of continuations, like class FactorialContinuation, as well as some example classes like classes Producer and Consumer in category Actalk-Ex-BoundedBuffer.
