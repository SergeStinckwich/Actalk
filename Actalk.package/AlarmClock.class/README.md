Class AlarmClock describes the alarm clock problem.

The alarm clock should wake up after a certain amount of time (represented as a number of ticks received).
Note that methods of AlarmClock have empty bodies, because this is a pure synchronization problem. See associated activity class AlarmClockActivity.

This solution has been initially described in the report on Synchronization Variables (see class InvocationActivity comment).
