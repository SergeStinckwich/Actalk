Class SymbolTable implements a symbol table implemented in a distributed fashion.
The initial algorithm is described in POOL by Pierre America in POOL-T: a Parallel Object-Oriented Language, in the OOCP book, MIT-Press, pages 213-218.
This algorithm is close to the one described in class QuickSortTree, in category Actalk-Ext-Accept-Examples.
