Class Book implements the example of multiple readers and writers accessing a single book by using synchronization counters.
Classes of activity BookActivity, ReaderPriorityBookActivity, and WriterPriorityBookActivity provide variations on synchronization constraints.

This class has been initially designed and implemented in a previous version of Actalk by a group of students of DESS of University of Nantes, under the guidance of Jean Bezivin and Olivier Roux.
