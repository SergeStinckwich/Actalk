Class Guards1BoundedBuffer implements the example of the bounded buffer with guards to specify synchronization.
Guard specification is expressed within the associated activity class in order to enforce a clear separation between program and control.
Note that because guard specifications are quite modular, they behave quite well against inheritance anomaly.
