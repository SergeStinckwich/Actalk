Class PriorityPrinter implements the example of the dynamic priority printer. (Each group of users gets assigned some priority. This priority may be reassigned dynamically).
Note that method updatePriorityOf:to: has no method body. It is pure synchronization.
See associated activity class PriorityPrinterActivity.

This solution has been initially described in the report on Synchronization Variables (see class InvocationActivity comment).
