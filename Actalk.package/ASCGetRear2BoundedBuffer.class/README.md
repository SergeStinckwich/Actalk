This class implements an example of inheritance anomaly. Note that the gget example is not very significant in a concurrent context. This example of getRear provides possible concurrency between two get methods (get and getRear) as they access to different memory zones.
In this second version we allow one get and one getRear to be served concurrently. Therefore we need to ensure that there at least two elements in the buffer.
